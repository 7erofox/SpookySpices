        <h3>Setting</h3>
        <p>I became vegetarian as a child. I'll try to avoid giving away how old I am, but at the time there was virtually no vegetarian bacon alternative on the market, especially in the country where I grew up. 
        There was one specifically that I remember, which was made by Linda McCartney, and it looked (and tasted) exactly like shoe insoles. As a result I typically ended up having sunflower seed toasties while the rest of my family had bacon butties.
        Now, in 2025, there are plenty of decent bacon alternatives, even in the country in which I live! But reading the ingredients would give anyone pause. So one morning around 2020, I sleepily chucked some tofu in a pan with dressing and then forgot about it while I went on a run, definitely aware that tofu thrives when marinated, but certainly not intentionally doing so. 
        When I came back, I turned on the pan while my partner made us coffee. They said it was the best facon they'd ever had, preferable even to the real thing. It's hard now to make ourselves buy Wicked Kitchen facon, Beyond meat, or even dreaded Linda McCartney - which I'm sure is much better now.</p>

          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <li>Tofu - as much as will fit in your pan. I would advise pressing it in advance</li>
          <li>Maple syrup</li>
          <li>Soy sauce</li>
          <li>Salt</li>
          <li>Pepper</li>
          <li>Paprika</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>If you haven't yet pressed your tofu, press your tofu for about 20 minutes, then slice thinly - 2-3mm.</p>
        <p>Lightly oil the pan or skillet, and lay tofu strips flat.</p>
        <p>Evenly coat tofu in soy sauce either through drizzling or brushing. There should be a very shallow pool of soy sauce and oil in the pan when all strips are evenly coated.</p>
        <p>Drizzle with a tablespoon of maple syrup, and sprinkle a little paprika - I prefer unsmoked.</p>
        <p>Ignore to marinate for another 20 minutes. You can totally skip this step, but I find it makes for deeper flavours.</p>
        <p>Cook on medium high heat for about two minutes on each side while someone who loves you makes hot beverages.</p>
        <p>I love this facon served on the Biona sprouted rye bread, with veganaise, lettuce and cherry tomatoes, but it works great on its own, in salads, or carbonara.</p>
