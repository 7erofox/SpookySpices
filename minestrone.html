        <h3>Setting</h3>
        <p>Inspired by the Sardinian Minestrone, popularised by Dan Buettner's exploration of blue zones in his documentary, books, and also his ongoing work to his website, this minestrone hits a number of Greger's daily dozen in one pot. While the original recipe calls for a number of dried beans, this is a lazified version, easily adaptable, suitable for throwing in leftovers and making with the one stove ring we have available in our tinyhome. I often sub the pasta for buckwheat, wholewheat couscous or wait until the whole pot cooks and add leftover quinoa.</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>To a large pot, add coriander, paprika, italian herbs and a few tablespoons of water. Cook until colour changes and spices are fragrant. Blitz ginger, garlic and leek in chopper, and add this in too. Cook for a further two minutes.</p>
	<p>Blitz celery, carrots and baby potatoes. Add these to the pot with salt and chilli flakes, stir for a few minutes until generously coated in spices and toasted slightly. Cover with water, add stock cube and simmer for 15 minutes.</p>
	<p>Add your pasta, balsamic, beans and chopped tomatoes. Cook according to your pasta instructions, usually 7 minutes for white pasta, or 12 for wholewheat. At this point the soup usually benefits from another cup or two of water, to help the pasta cook faster.</p>
	<p>Serve in a bowl with a good splash of EVOO and your favourite fresh herbs.</p>
