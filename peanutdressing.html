        <h3>Setting</h3>
        <p>An Asian inspired classic, a cozy staple and every vegan has a version of this in their back pocket. Thin out with water, miso and a stock cube to make a dreamy ramen base, or use as a dip for veggies and rice paper rolls.</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Begin thinning out the peanut butter with water, adding one tablespoon at a time. I use a fork for this but I know a lot of folks who whisk these kinds of dressings, or chuck all ingredients into a blender</p>
        <p>Stir in one tablespoon of soy sauce at a time, mixing well between each, then add the remaining ingredients.</p>
        <p>This recipe is especially nice with freshly minced ginger and garlic, but typically when I make this, I am looking for something I can throw together quickly.</p>
        <p>Optional additions include hot sauce, sriracha, sesame seeds and EVOO.</p>
