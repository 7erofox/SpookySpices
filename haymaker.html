        <h3>Setting</h3>
        <p>This drink has had a number of names, some sensible like Switchel, or lazy bucha, and others not so sensible, like AJ's special fixer elixir. Either way we chug large volumes of it every time we feel sniffly, tired, or a little run down.</p>

          <li>2 Lemons</li>

          <li>Small piece of turmeric</li>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Chop up your ginger and turmeric, skins and all, simmer with your whole spices and salt in 1 - 2 Litres of water for 5 minutes. I like to add any lemon or orange peels I have lying about too.</p>
        <p>Add the juiced lemons, ACV and maple syrup, stir well and drink hot for a cozy remedy, or cold for an energising kombucha alternative.</p>
        <p>Lasts in our fridge for less than a day, since we drink it all immediately - but it make the kitchen smell really nice while it simmers.</p>
