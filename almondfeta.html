        <h3>Setting</h3>
        <p>
          This is a combination of a number of recipes I have tried over the
          years. You can definitely enjoy this without baking it at the end
          which gives something more akin to cream cheese or boursin, but baking
          it definitely gives a feta like taste and texture. We get our ground
          almonds in bulk from an Asian Supermarket.

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <p>
          Blend all ingredients together - I would like to add here that our
          little chopper does not work for this recipe. We need to use a real
          electric blender.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spoon mixture into a muslin cloth, clean tea towel, or cheesecloth in
          a refrigeratable box or bowl.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gently squeeze excess moisture, then leave to drain any further
          moisture for the next 12h or so.
        </p>
        <p>Bake at 180 degrees for 40 minutes.</p>
        <p>
          Enjoy on toast, in salads, on pasta... if you skip the garlic this
          makes a beautiful cheesecake base or decadent filling in puff pastry
          or tart.
