        <h3>Setting</h3>
        <p>
          This stew tastes like a cuddle. It's what I crave when I'm sick, sad
          or tired. It comes together really quickly, uses relatively cheap
          ingredients, and you don't need to babysit it.

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Blitz garlic and ginger, add to a pot with all spices, and oil.</p>
        <p>Cook on a medium heat until fragrant.</p>
        <p>
          Blitz up leek and celery, and add these too, stirring to coat evenly
          for 3-5 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add lentils and blitzed sweet potatoes, coat in oil and spices, then
          add salt, pepper and chilli flakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cover with water and bring to a boil. At this point you are welcome to
          add stock cube(s), but we find we often don't need to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lower to a simmer and ignore until sweet potatoes and lentils are
          fully cooked - about 25 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add coconut milk and cruciferous vegetables - we typically add chard
          or kale since this is what we often have growing, but broccoli,
          cabbage, cauliflower and brussels sprouts work great too - and simmer
          for another five minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Top with seasonal fresh herbs, and enjoy with a huge chunk of bread,
          oatgurt, or whatever else you might want.
