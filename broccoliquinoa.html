        <h3>Setting</h3>
        <p>I lived on this as my main meal for years, it was a staple in the cafe in which I worked at the time. Nutty, light and nutritionally dense it really sustained me through my early twenties.</p>

          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <li>Two cups of Quinoa, cooked according to packaging instructions</li>
          <li>One head of broccoli, chopped into bite size pieces</li>
          <li>A few handfuls of rocket</li>
          <li>A vine or two of cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
          <li>One third of a cup of toasted sesame seeds</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons of Soy Sauce</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon of ACV</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons of EVOO</li>
          <li>Cumin to taste</li>
          <li>Pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Combine the Soy Sauce, Vinegar, EVOO, cumin and pepper.</p>
        <p>Add the broccoli to the dressing and coat well. Leave to sit for a few minutes so that the broccoli can absorb as much dressing as possible.</p>
        <p>Add in the cherry tomatoes, stirring to coat well, then add the quinoa.</p>
        <p>Mix in rocket and sesame seeds.</p>
        <p>Add extra seasoning if you need some, but I find that as long as I coat the broccoli in the dressing first, the dish is pretty flavourful.</p>
